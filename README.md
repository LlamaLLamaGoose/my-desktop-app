# Todo

## Taskbar
- [ ] Start/Windows button
    - [ ] Settings
        - [ ] Change theme/dark mode?
        - [ ] Font size?
    - [ ] Terminal?
        - [ ] https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/
        - [ ] Create a few commands to display some info in the terminal?
    - [ ] Task Manager?
        - [ ] Allow to see running apps
            - [ ] Close apps from within it?
- [ ] Opened draggables
    - [ ] Clicking this will need to focus the draggable and move it to the top
- [ ] Time/date
    - [ ] Clicking it opens a clock?

## Desktop
- [ ] Add Apps/DraggableIcons
    - [ ] If you click the icon while it's open, it should focus the draggable and increase it's zIndex so it's at the open again.
    - [ ] On a grid?
        - [ ] I'll need to see if I can do something to prevent being able to overlap them
- [ ] Some more fancy background?
    - [ ] Something animated using js/css or something using ThreeJS

## Draggables
- [x] Import Rnd (Resize and drag)
- [x] Set the Bounds to stay on the desktop
- [x] Add Minimize / FullScreen/Restore and Close
    - [x] Adding FullScreen
    - [x] Adding Restore
    - [ ] Adding Minimize
            - [ ] for minimize I'll need to add a taskbar so you can see it and reopen it when it's minimized.
                        - [ ] If you click the icon while it's minimized, it should show it again
    - [ ] Adding Close
        - [ ] For open/close I'll need to add icons that you can double click to open up the draggable and to close it


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

- [ ]- [ ]Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!- [ ]- [ ]

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
